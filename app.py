    -   **Server-Side Download Limitations:** This version *attempts* to download videos to the Streamlit server. However, **this is NOT a reliable or scalable solution for publicly hosted apps.** Streamlit is not a file hosting service, and dynamically downloaded files will likely be ephemeral and unaccessible externally.
    -   **Resource Consumption:** Performing downloads on the server consumes significant resources (bandwidth, storage, CPU) of the hosting environment. This can lead to app slowdowns or shutdowns.
    -   **Link Validity:** The "Server Download URL" provided will almost certainly **NOT work** from a client's browser if the app is deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud or similar platforms.
    -   **Best Practice:** For reliable direct downloads, you should **always use the 'original_youtube_cdn_url'** provided by `pytubefix` and let the user's browser or download manager handle the download directly from YouTube's CDN. This offloads the burden from your server.
